# 🎙️ Health Connector AI: 2-Minute Demo Script

## 0:00 - Introduction (The Problem)
"Every day, millions of people live in 'medical deserts'—areas where healthcare is out of reach when every second counts. We built **Health Connector AI** to turn raw facility data into actionable life-saving intelligence."

## 0:30 - The WOW Map (Visualization)
"Starting with our **Live Coverage Map**, we’ve created a 'wow-factor' experience. You see these pulsing red and orange zones? Those are medical deserts calculated in real-time. Notice the **mega glows** and immersive animations that highlight critical gaps. When I click a desert, our **Intelligent Zoom** flies us straight into the heart of the underserved area."

## 0:50 - Smart Filters (Intelligence)
"Our **Smart Filter** panel—conveniently tucked in the bottom-left—gives you pinpoint control. Whether you're looking for critical-status hospitals or underserved clinics, you can toggle them instantly. And when you need more map space, it collapses downward with a smooth animation, keeping the focus on the data."

## 1:15 - AI-Powered Insights (Context)
"But we don't just show locations; we provide brainpower. When I click a hospital, our **AI Insight Engine** delivers sharp, concise intelligence. Look at this: it calculates **Network Centrality**, showing Adiebeba Hospital has 921 connections as a regional hub. It assesses quality, population reach within a 2km radius, and even gives a strategic recommendation—all powered by AI."

## 1:40 - Vulnerability Reporting (Action)
"Finally, we synthesize this into our **Insights Dashboard**. We track **Population at Risk**—currently 3.5 Million people in these deserts. We provide a regional breakdown that meets WHO standards. The bottom line? A clear call to action: '75 Facilities Need Attention.' You can export this entire report instantly for health officials to drive real change."

## 2:00 - Conclusion
"Health Connector AI isn't just a map—it's the intelligence layer for global healthcare equity. Thank you."
